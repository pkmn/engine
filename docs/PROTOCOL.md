# Protocol

At a high level, the pkmn engine updates a battle's state based on both players'
[choices](#choices), returning a [result](#result) which indicates whether the battle has ended and
what each players' options are. A non-terminal result can be fed into a generation's `choices`
method which returns all legal actions[^1], though the state of the engine may also be inspected
directly to determine information about the battle and which moves are possible. By
[design](DESIGN.md), each generation's data structures are different, but the precise layout of the
battle information is outlined in the respective documentation.

More information about a battle can be generated via the `-Dlog` flag when building the engine.
This flag enables the engine to write the wire protocol described in this document to a `Log`.
Generally, this `Log` should be a
[`FixedBufferStream`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#root;io.FixedBufferStream)
[`Writer`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#root;io.Writer) backed by a statically
allocated fixed-size array that gets `reset` after each `update` as the maximum number of bytes
written by a single `update` call is bounded to a [relatively small number of bytes](#size) per
generation, though since any `Writer` implementation is allowed this `Log` could instead write to
standard output (note that in Zig the standard out writer isn't buffered by default - you must use
a [`BufferedWriter`](https://zig.news/kristoff/how-to-add-buffering-to-a-writer-reader-in-zig-7jd)
wrapper to achieve reasonable performance).

The engine's wire protocol essentially amounts to a stripped down binary translation of [Pokémon
Showdown's simulator
protocol](https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown/blob/master/sim/SIM-PROTOCOL.md), with certain
redundant messages (e.g. `|upkeep|` or `|`) removed, and others subtly tweaked (there is no
`|split|` message - the "omniscient" stream of information is always provided and other streams
must be recreated by driver code). Like the rest of the pkmn engine, the protocol uses
**native-endianness**. While the protocol may change slightly depending on the generation in question
(e.g. a `Move` requires more than a single byte to encode after Generation I & II), any differences
are called out where applicable.

[^1]: The `choices` method leaks information in certain cases where legal decisions would not be
known to a user until after having already attempted a choice (e.g. that a Pokémon has been trapped
or has had a move that has been blocked due to an opponent's use of
[Imprison](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Imprison_(move))). This is a non-issue for the
use case of games being played out randomly via a machine, but a simulator for human players built
on top of the pkmn engine would need to provide an alternative implementation of `choices`.

### Debugging

The [`pkmn-debug`](../README.md#pkmn-debug) tool exists to decode the binary battle and log data and
render HTML to power a [human-readable debug UI](https://pkmn.cc/debug.html). The tool expects the
following debug information to be provided to it by a binary with `-Dloh` enabled.

#### Header

Debug logs must start with a header which contains a byte to indicate whether `-Dshowdown`
compatibility mode was enabled, a byte indicating the
[generation](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Generation), and the initial battle state:


| Start | End | Description                                                                              |
| ----- | --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | 1   | Whether Pokémon Showdown compatibility is enabled                                        |
| 1     | 2   | A number denoting the Pokémon generation                                                 |
| 2     | B+2 | The $B$ serialized bytes of the initial battle state as defined by its respective layout |

#### Frame

Following the header there maybe be any number of "frames", the last of which may be only partially
complete:

| Start | End   | Description                                                                                                         |
| ----- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | N     | $N$ bytes of log message protocol that are terminated by `0x00` or [EOF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-file) |
| N+1   | N+B+1 | The $B$ serialized bytes of the updated battle state as defined by its respective layout                            |
| N+B+2 | N+B+3 | The [result](#result) of updating the battle                                                                        |
| N+B+3 | N+B+4 | The next [choice](#choice) for Player 1                                                                             |
| N+B+4 | N+B+5 | The next [choice](#choice) for Player 2                                                                             |

It's important to note that by convention the debug logs start with the protocol logs that are
produced **after** first battle update (i.e. both sides `|switch|`-ing in their first Pokémon) -
**the initial battle state when no Pokémon are active and the initial required choices (pass from
both sides) and result aren't logged.**[^2]

[^2]: In generations with [Team
Preview](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Appendix:Metagame_terminology#Team_Preview) it's
likely that the convention around the initial data frame will change and that a `0x00` dummy byte
will be used for the pre-battle log, though given that the engine currently doesn't support these
later generations such changes are speculative.

### Choice

The valid options returned by `choices` can be one of three types: `pass`, which will only ever
occurs in situations where only the other player gets to make a decision (e.g. when choosing which
Pokémon to switch to after their active Pokémon faints or uses Baton Pass etc), and `move` or
`switch`, which require additional data. These are comparable to the similarly named choice commands
in [Pokémon Showdown's own
SIM-PROTOCOL](https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown/blob/master/sim/SIM-PROTOCOL.md#possible-choices).

| Raw    | Type     | Data? |
| ------ | -------- | ----- |
| `0x00` | `pass`   | No    |
| `0x01` | `move`   | 0-4   |
| `0x02` | `switch` | 2-6   |

`switch` takes a 1-based Pokémon slot number of an eligible party member (which must be greater than
1 as you can never switch in the active Pokémon) and `move` takes a 1-based move slot number, though
is expected to be 0 in certain scenarios where the cartridge doesn't present an option to select a
move after signalling the intent to fight (e.g. during Wrap or Bide in Generation I)[^3]. Determining
exactly which choice options are available is subtle and should be left to the engine - choices not
present in the array filled in by `choices` are invalid and may corrupt the battle state or cause
the engine to crash.

[^3]: The data value for a move choice `move` must be in the range of 1-4 when in Pokémon Showdown
compatibility mode as its choice selection behavior is different (i.e. incorrect).

### Result

Each battle update returns a result object that's made up of three things - a result type and a
choice type for either player. Any result other than `None` means that the battle is considered to
be over and no further updates can be made and may result in crashes.

| Raw    | Description      |
| ------ | ---------------- |
| `0x00` | None             |
| `0x01` | Player 1 Wins    |
| `0x02` | Player 2 Wins    |
| `0x03` | Player 1 & 2 Tie |
| `0x04` | Error            |

`Error` can only be returned due to a desync/glitch, and since Pokémon Showdown mods its engine code
to avoid these this value can't be returned from an update in `-Dshowdown` mode. However, the
`libpkmn` C API will also set an update's result to `Error` if `-Dlog` protocol logging is enabled
and the buffer it has been provided runs out of space regardless of which mode its in.

The choice types included in the result match those described [earlier](#choices), though they're
more akin to what Pokémon Showdown calls a sides `requestType` which determines which [choice
request](https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown/blob/master/sim/SIM-PROTOCOL.md#choice-requests)
the side gets. In the pkmn engine the choice type from a result for a given side should similarly be
provided to the `choices` function to determine which choice options exist for the side.

## Overview

With `-Dlog` enabled, [messages](#messages) are written to the `Log` provided. The first byte of
each message is an integer representing the `ArgType` of the message, followed by 0 or more bytes
containing the payload of the message. Game objects such as moves, species, abilities, items, types,
etc are written as their internal identifier which usually matches their public facing number, but
in cases where these differ the [`ids.json`](../src/pkg/data/ids.json) can  be used to decode them. A
[`protocol.json`](../src/data/protocol.json) containing a human-readable lookup for the `ArgType`
and various "[reason](#reason)" enums (see below) is generated from the library code and can be used
for similar purposes.

Because each protocol message is a fixed length, parsing can be terminated when a `0x00` byte is
read when the leading `ArgType` header byte of a message is expected. Note that a `0x00` byte may
also appear internally within the payload of a message - only the `0x00` in the header of a message
indicates the end. This `0x00` byte will be written even in places where the previous `ArgType`
alone would be sufficient to indicate the end of parsing (e.g. after reading a `|win|` or `|turn|`
message). Unlike the Pokémon Showdown simulator protocol, the pkmn engine's protocol doesn't
produce a `|request|` message - as outlined earlier a driver should inspect the raw bytes of the
`Battle` object in addition to the `Result` to determine enough about state to determine which
choices are possible (taking into account privileged information depending on the side in question).

### Reason

Several protocol messages have a "reason" field which provides further information/context about the
message and may indicate that the payload contains additional bytes. Bytes that are only present
when the reason field is a specific value are indicated by a trailing `?`. Messages which contain a
reason field will document each possible value the field can take and whether or not the specific
reason will cause the message to contain additional data. Reason fields are required to be able to
encode the information Pokémon Showdown stores in its "keyword args" (`kwArgs`) mapping (e.g.
`[from]` or `[of]`).

### `PokemonIdent`

Many protocol message types encode the source/target/actor as a `PokemonIdent` (or Pokémon ID). From
Pokémon Showdown's documentation:

> A Pokémon ID is in the form `POSITION: NAME`.
>
> - `POSITION` is the spot that the Pokémon is in: it consists of the `PLAYER` of the player
>   (see `|player|`), followed by a position letter (`a` in singles).
> - `NAME` is the nickname of the Pokémon (or the species name, if no nickname is given).
>
> For example: `p1a: Sparky` could be a Charizard named Sparky. `p1: Dragonite` could be an
> inactive Dragonite being healed by Heal Bell.
>
> For most commands, you can just use the position information in the Pokémon ID to identify
> the Pokémon. Only a few commands actually change the Pokémon in that position (`|switch|`
> switching, `|replace|` illusion dropping, `|drag|` phazing, and `|detailschange|` permanent
> forme changes), and these all specify `DETAILS` for you to perform updates with.

Identity works a little differently in the pkmn engine, given that nicknames aren't part of the
engine. While the given player, position letter and identity of the Pokémon in question are all
still encoded, the identity takes the form of a single bit-packed byte:

- the most significant 3 bits are always `0`
- the fourth most significant bit is `0` if the position is `a` and `1` if the position is `b` (only
  relevant in doubles battles)
- the fifth most significant bit is `0` for player 1 and `1` for player 2.
- the lowest 3 bits represent the slot (`1` through `6` inclusive) of the Pokémon's original
  location within the party (i.e. the order a player's team was initially in when the battle
  started, before any Pokémon were switched).

A Pokémon Showdown-compatible `PokemonIdent` can be translated from the pkmn engine identity
by driver code provided there exists a mapping from the party's original positions and Pokémon
nicknames.

### `LastStill`/`LastMiss`

Unfortunately, Pokémon Showdown's protocol doesn't allow for translating a single message at a time
in isolation. The `|move|` message can be modified by a message with the `LastStill` (`0x01`) or
`LastMiss` (`0x02`) `ArgType`. In the Pokémon Showdown simulator the `attrLastMove` method is used
to modify a batched `|move|` message before it's written with other messages as a single chunk, but
the pkmn engine streams out writes immediately and doesn't perform batching, meaning code parsing
the engine's protocol is required to do the batching instead.

When interpreting a buffer written by the pkmn `Log`: if a `LastStill` (`0x01`) byte is encountered
and if there is a previous `|move|` message in the same buffer that occurred earlier, append a
`[still]` keyword arg to it. Similarly, if a `LastMiss` (`0x02`) byte is encountered, append a
`[miss]` to the last seen `|move|` message if present.

`Source` is the [`PokemonIdent`](#pokemonident) of the Pokémon that used the `Move` on the
[`PokemonIdent`](#pokemonident) `Target` for `Reason`. If `Reason` is `0x01` then the next byte
will indicate which `Move` the `|move|` is `[from]`. This message may be modified later on by a
`LastStill` or `LastMiss` message in the same buffer (preceding).

## Size

As mentioned earlier, any `Writer` can be used to back the protocol `Log`, and as such something like
an [`ArrayList.Writer`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#root;ArrayList) can be used to
support arbitrary amounts of data being written to the log each update. For performance reasons it
is desirable to be able to pre-allocate a fixed size buffer for this, where the recommended size is
determined by `pkmn.LOGS_SIZE` which is guaranteed to be able to handle at least `pkmn.MAX_LOGS`
bytes (these constants are defined to be the maximum of all generations - each generation also has
its own parallel constants that can be used instead, e.g. `pkmn.gen1.LOGS_SIZE`).

Determining the maximum amount of bytes in a single update (i.e. bytes logged by a call to `update`
with each player's `Choice`) per generation is non-trivial and could vary greatly depending on the
constraints:

- **Standard**: The most restrictive constraint supported is one which considers Pokémon Showdown's
  "Standard" restrictions for competitive formats - Species Clause, Cleric Clause, movepool legality
  and bans, etc.
- **Cartridge**: Cartridge legality still enforces anything that can be legitimately obtained on the
  cartridge and used in link battles, but doesn't enforce any of Pokémon Showdown's clauses or mods.
- [**"Hackmons"**](https://www.smogon.com/articles/pure-hackmons-introduction): A step further than
  cartridge legality, removing restrictions on moves / items / abilities / types / stats / etc -
  anything which can be hacked into the game before the battle.
- **Fuzzing**: Used for testing, the same "hackmons" constraints but also allowing for arbitrary
  in-battle manipulation as well to be able to set impossible combinations of volatiles statuses or
  side conditions etc.

Furthermore, a **lax** vs. **strict** interpretation of the RNG can be applied - whether or not any
conceivable sequence of events should be considered or only those which can be obtained in practice
via the actual RNG (on either the cartridge or Pokémon Showdown).

In general, the constants are be defined such that they're guaranteed to be sufficient under
**cartridge constraints with a lax consideration of the RNG** (though taking a strict interpretation
of the RNG is required in some cases to be able to conservatively set the upper bounds in specific
scenarios). In practice, the constants will usually be defined to handle "hackmons" legality as that
is what's useful for the engine's fuzz testing - see the precise definitions below for exact
details. In most cases these scenarios have been derived with the [Z3 theorem
prover](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3).

*The following maximum log size scenarios were developed with help from
[**@gigalh128**](https://github.com/gigalh128).*

### Generation I

The `MAX_LOGS` constant in Generation I is determined to be **180**. Achieving this requires two
burned Aerodactyl with Leech Seed, Confuse Ray, and Metronome where one is slower than the other. On
the first two turns of the battle the Aerodactyl both use Leech Seed followed by Confuse Ray, and
then in the turn where the maximum single update output is to be reached, the faster Aerodactyl uses
Metronome to proc a critical hit Fury Swipes that hits 5 times and the slower Aerodactyl uses
Metronome to proc Mirror Move which then also procs a critical hit Fury Swipes that hits 5 times.
The initial battle seed required to achieve this is output is $\{180, 137, 181, 165, 16, 97, 148,
20, 25\}$.

<details><summary>Details</summary>

In order to maximize log message size in Generation I several observations need to be made:

- `|move`, `|switch|`, `|-damage|`, and `|-heal|` take up the most space in the log
- `|switch|` will result in less bytes than `|move|` because it won't result in any additional
  messages  whereas `|move|` can trigger many others, including `|-damage|` or `|-heal|`
- `|move|` should `|-crit|` and either be `|-supereffective|` or `|-resisted|` to use up more bytes
- before a `|move|` a Pokémon can activate confusion, and after residual damage from a poison or
  burn status, Leech Seed can be triggered
- neither Pokémon can `|faint|` at the end. While initially it might seem like having both
  `|faint|` and causing one side to `|win|` would be optimal (two `|faint|` messages and one `|win|`
  is 6 bytes total, a single `|faint|` and a `|turn|` message is 5 bytes), if a side faints you
  miss out on a round of damage and healing from Leech Seed which is 16 bytes
- Substitute activating actually reduces the size of the log as `|-activate|` replaces the larger
  `|-damage|` messages, and in Generation I if a substitute breaks it nullifies the rest of the
  move's effects
- ultimately a `MultiHit` move is optimal as it can generate 5 `|-damage|` messages and a
  `|-hitcount|`

The most important observation is that **Metronome and Mirror Move can be used in tandem to rack up
arbitrary increases in log size via mutual recursion**. Metronome and Mirror Move handlers both
contain checks to prevent infinite self-recursion, but don't check for each other, meaning a
Pokémon can use Metronome to proc Mirror Move to copy their opponent's Metronome to proc Mirror Move
again etc. However, since Mirror Move works based on the `last_used_move` field and Metronome using
a new move overwrites this field, Mirror Move copying an opponent's original Metronome will only
work if a charging move is triggered by the initial Metronome, meaning the other player can not also
perform this loop (and can actually not use a move on their turn at all, as they would then be
locked in by the previous turn's charging move used via Metronome).

With true randomness it seems at face value that with the proper set up the chances of achieving
Metronome → Mirror Move calls would be ${1 \over 163}^N$ (given Metronome can choose 1 out of 163
moves), which while vanishingly small as $N$ increases is still possible. However, both Pokémon Red
and Pokémon Showdown use *pseudo*-random number generators and thus to find the way out of this
potential infinite recursion one must strictly consider what's actually possibly with the RNG, and
not just what would be possible in theory.

In Pokémon Showdown there are several frame advances between each call (e.g. a consequential roll to
hit, an advance to re-target, etc) and setting up the RNG to accomplish arbitrary recursion isn't
feasible in practice. However, in Pokémon Red there is only an inconsequential (i.e. the value is
ignored) critical hit roll for both Metronome and Mirror Move between each roll to determine which
move to use and the seed can be used to set up 9 arbitrary values. Define $X$, $X'$, and $X''$ such
that $X' = 5X+1 \bmod 256$ and $X'' = 5X'+1 \bmod 256$. $X'' = 119$ is required to cause Metronome
to use Mirror Move, so $X' = 126$ and $X = 25$.

Thus starting with a seed of $\{25, 126, 56, 25, 126, 56, 25, 126, 56\}$ achieves 9 levels of
recursive Metronome → Mirror Move calls from the output values. This is an **upper bound** (in
reality it would be impossible to set up the rest of the battle, do 9 rounds of recursion, and still
have optimal rolls on the other side to be able to obtain maximum log size) and only applies to a
single player (as mentioned earlier the only way to have Mirror Move copy Metronome is if the
opponent is locked into a charging move from a previous Metronome call).

There are then two hypothetical scenarios that must be considered to determine the upper bound on
the maximum log size of a single update - one where a single player gets to benefit from the
Metronome → Mirror Move → ... → Metronome → multi-hit move and the other side is locked into a
charging move or one where both players simply call a multi-hit move through a single iteration of
Metronome → Mirror Move → multi-hit.

- **Scenario 1:** recursion + charge move (188 bytes)
  - `|-activate|` confusion: 2×3 bytes
  - `|move|` Metronome → `|move|` Mirror Move P1 recursion: 1×5 + 9×6 bytes
  - `|move|` multi-hit: 6 bytes
  - `|move|` P2 turn 2 charging move: 6 bytes
  - `|-crit|`: 2×2 bytes
  - `|supereffective|` or `|resisted|`: 2×2 bytes
  - `|-damage|` multi-hit: 5×8 bytes
  - `|-hitcount|`: 3 bytes
  - `|-damage|` charging: 8 bytes
  - `|-damage|` poison or burn: 2×8 bytes
  - `|-damage|` Leech Seed: 2×8 bytes
  - `|-heal|` Leech Seed: 2×8 bytes
  - `|turn|`: 3 bytes
  - `0x00`: 1 byte (end of buffer)
- **Scenario 2:** both multi-hit (186 bytes)
  - `|-activate|` confusion: 2×3 bytes
  - `|move|` Metronome → `|move|` Mirror Move -> `|move|` multi-hit: 2×5 + 4×6 bytes
  - `|-crit|`: 2×2 bytes
  - `|supereffective|` or `|resisted|`: 2×2 bytes
  - `|-damage|` multi-hit: 10×8 bytes
  - `|-hitcount|`: 2×3 bytes
  - `|-damage|` poison or burn: 2×8 bytes
  - `|-damage|` Leech Seed: 2×8 bytes
  - `|-heal|` Leech Seed: 2×8 bytes
  - `|turn|`: 3 bytes
  - `0x00`: 1 byte (end of buffer)

Z3 can be used to test out these scenarios -  it can be shown that despite 9 levels of recursive
Metronome → Mirror Move being possible in a vacuum from the initial seed, there is no way to achieve
the first scenario after burning through the rolls on the first two turns of setup to be able to
still proc specific Metronome rolls after. For the second scenario the problem is that there needs
to be an extra turn of setup for Player 1 to be able to Mirror Move a multi-hit move which also
takes too many rolls after the initial seed to be able to set up the rest of the scenario. However,
by slightly compromising and not requiring Player 1 to proc Mirror Move only lose 6 bytes and thus
arrive at 180 bytes for the maximum log size for Generation I.
