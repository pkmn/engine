# Contributing

Please read through the [README](../README.md), [docs](../docs), and
[pkmn.cc/@pkmn](https://pkmn.cc/@pkmn/) for general information about the pkmn engine and about
development on `@pkmn` projects respectively. The pkmn engine Zig code loosely adheres to the [style
guidelines outlined by
TigerBeetle](https://github.com/tigerbeetledb/tigerbeetle/blob/main/docs/TIGER_STYLE.md), whereas
the TypeScript code follows the usual [`@pkmn` style](https://pkmn.cc/@pkmn/#style). When opening
issues or pull requests, please use one of the existing templates and fill them out to the best of
your ability. Pull requests are unlikely to be merged without tests, but it is fine to open a pull
request without tests for feedback or to ask for help with testing. :)
