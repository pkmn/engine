# Contributing

Please read through the [README](README.md), [docs](docs), and
[pkmn.cc/@pkmn](https://pkmn.cc/@pkmn/) for general information about the pkmn engine and about
development on `@pkmn` projects respectively. When opening issues or pull requests, please use one
of the existing templates and fill them out to the best of your ability. Pull requests are unlikely
to be merged without tests, but it is fine to open a pull request without tests for feedback or to
ask for help with testing. :)
