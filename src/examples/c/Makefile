# On the GitHub CI where this example runs we install everything locally instead of using something
# like `--prefix /usr/local` which complicates things as we can't rely on default search semantics.
#
# `suffix` (to opt into libpkmn-showdown) or `dynamic` may be set to opt into different linking
# semantics. `options` is a bit of a hack to simplify the GitHub CI as its easier than passing
# the correct suffix in the YAML.
#
# The OS won't know where to look for our dynamic libraries unless we configure the rpath to bake it
# into the executable (or set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, use `install_name_tool`, etc). Sadly, the flag
# requires a different syntax ($ORIGIN vs. @executable_path) for relative paths based on OS.
# Of course, Windows doesn't support any of this (https://ibob.bg/blog/2018/12/16/windows-rpath/)
# so we just give up and copy the files into the current directory directly. This isn't required
# for static linking on Windows, but for simplicity we copy the artifacts anyway.
#
# On macOS we also need to set `-mmacosx-version-min` on our executable as Zig will set the precise
# version on the library it builds which will result in warnings as the default for the C executable
# would otherwise just be the major version.
#
# Possibly due to some Zig or MinGW issue we need to also need to link against
# 'C:/Windows/System32/ntdll.dll' (which can't be statically linked to?) - when compiling the C code
# with the Zig toolchain this will get automatically linked. Some documentation suggests that GCC
# requires the static library to be named libpkmn.a instead of pkmn.lib, but the latter seems to
# work fine.
